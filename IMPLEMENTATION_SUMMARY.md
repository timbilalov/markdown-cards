# Markdown Cards Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the security features implemented in the Markdown Cards application. The implementation includes authentication, authorization, rate limiting, HTTPS enforcement, security headers, and comprehensive logging.

## Authentication System

### HTTP Basic Authentication
- Implemented using HTTP Basic Auth with encrypted credentials
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `********` (stored as bcrypt hash)
- Credentials are validated in `src/lib/server/auth.ts`

### Password Hashing
- Uses bcryptjs library with 12 salt rounds
- Password hash: `*******************************************`
- Custom script to generate new password hashes: `scripts/generatePasswordHash.ts`

### Environment Variable Handling
- Created custom environment variable loader (`src/lib/utils/envLoader.ts`) to avoid issues with SvelteKit's built-in env handling
- This solved the issue with truncated password hashes in SvelteKit's environment variable loading

## Authorization

### Protected Routes
All routes require authentication:
- `POST /api/save` - Save a card
- `GET /api/files` - List all files
- `GET /markdown/[filename]` - Serve markdown files
- `GET /` - Main page
- `GET /card/[slug]` - View a specific card

### Public Routes
The following routes do not require authentication:
- Static assets (favicon, etc.)

## Rate Limiting

### Implementation
- 100 requests per hour per IP address
- Implemented with an in-memory store in `src/hooks.server.ts`
- Automatic cleanup of expired records every hour
- Returns 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header when limit is exceeded

### Configuration
- Rate limit: 100 requests per hour
- Time window: 1 hour (3,600,000 milliseconds)
- Store: In-memory Map for tracking requests per IP

## HTTPS Enforcement

### Implementation
- Automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS in production environments
- Controlled by `NODE_ENV` environment variable
- Implemented in `src/hooks.server.ts`

### Behavior
- In development: No HTTPS enforcement
- In production: Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS

## Security Headers

### Implemented Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

### Implementation
- Set in `src/hooks.server.ts` using securityHeadersMiddleware

## Logging

### Logger Implementation
- Custom logger utility in `src/lib/utils/logger.ts`
- Supports different log levels: debug, info, warn, error
- Outputs to console with timestamp and log level

### Logged Events
- Successful and failed login attempts
- Rate limit exceeded events
- Unauthorized access attempts
- General application events

## Deployment Configuration

### Vercel Configuration
- Security headers configured in `vercel.json`
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- Optimized for Vercel deployment

### Environment Variables
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: The admin username for authentication
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`: The bcrypt hashed password for the admin user

## Testing

### Test Scripts
- Various API endpoints tested with curl commands

### Test Endpoints
- Various API endpoints tested with curl commands

## Key Implementation Files

### Authentication
- `src/lib/server/auth.ts` - Credential validation functions
- `src/lib/utils/envLoader.ts` - Custom environment variable loader
- `src/hooks.server.ts` - Authentication middleware

### API Endpoints
- `src/routes/api/save/+server.ts` - Save card endpoint
- `src/routes/api/files/+server.ts` - List files endpoint
- `src/routes/markdown/[filename]/+server.ts` - Serve markdown files

### Utilities
- `src/lib/utils/logger.ts` - Custom logging utility
- `scripts/generatePasswordHash.ts` - Password hash generation script

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Credential Management
- Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes, never in plain text
- Environment variables used for sensitive data
- .env file excluded from version control

### Access Control
- All endpoints protected with authentication
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

### Secure Communication
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers to prevent common vulnerabilities
- No sensitive data logged in plain text

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging of authentication attempts
- Rate limit events logged for monitoring
- Error conditions properly handled and logged

## Conclusion

The Markdown Cards application now has a comprehensive security implementation that includes authentication, authorization, rate limiting, HTTPS enforcement, security headers, and logging. The application is ready for secure deployment to production environments.
