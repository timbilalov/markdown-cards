# Cloud Storage Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to integrate cloud storage (Yandex Disk) into the Markdown Cards application while maintaining backward compatibility and adding robust offline support.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Service Improvements
- Modified `src/lib/services/dbService.ts` to handle server-side usage properly
- Added browser environment checks before using IndexedDB
- Implemented mock implementations for server-side usage that return appropriate default values
- Ensured database operations are skipped on the server-side

### 2. API Routes Creation
Created three new API routes for cloud functionality:
- `/api/cloud/files` - Lists files from Yandex Disk
- `/api/cloud/download` - Downloads files from Yandex Disk
- `/api/cloud/upload` - Uploads files to Yandex Disk

### 3. Cloud Store Updates
Modified `src/lib/stores/cloudStore.ts` to use the new API routes:
- Updated `syncFilesFromCloud` to use the files API route
- Updated `loadCardFromCloud` to use the download API route
- Updated `saveCardToCloud` to use the upload API route
- Removed Authorization headers from requests (now handled by server-side environment variables)
- Removed direct cloudService usage

### 4. Card Store Updates
Updated `src/lib/stores/cardStore.ts` to use the new cloudStore functions and API routes:
- Modified `loadCard` to use cloudStore functions
- Ensured proper fallback to local cache when cloud operations fail

### 5. Route Updates
- Updated `src/routes/card/[slug]/+page.svelte` to load card data on mount
- Created `src/routes/card/[slug]/+page.ts` for server-side data loading
- Updated `src/routes/+page.svelte` to remove unused imports and fix authentication flow

### 6. Server Hooks Updates
Modified `src/hooks.server.ts`:
- Removed database initialization code
- Updated authMiddleware to skip authentication for API routes

### 7. Type Definitions
Updated `src/app.d.ts` to include the accessToken property in the Locals type

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Listing from Cloud Storage
- Fetches list of files from Yandex Disk
- Proper error handling for network issues and authentication failures
- Caching of file list in IndexedDB

### 2. File Content Retrieval with Local Caching
- Downloads file content from Yandex Disk
- Caches content locally in IndexedDB
- Implements cache validation to ensure up-to-date content

### 3. Dual Persistence
- Maintains data in both IndexedDB (local) and Yandex Disk (cloud)
- Automatic synchronization between local and remote storage
- Offline support with automatic synchronization when online

### 4. File Saving with Upload to Cloud Storage
- Saves files to both local cache and cloud storage
- Handles network operation errors gracefully
- Provides user feedback on save operations

### 5. Authentication
- OAuth token authentication with Yandex Disk
- Token configured via environment variables (VITE_YANDEX_DISK_TOKEN)
- Proper handling of authentication status

### 6. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for network operations
- User feedback for error conditions
- Fallback to local cache when cloud operations fail

## Architecture

The implementation follows a dual persistence architecture:
1. Client-side code uses Svelte stores for state management
2. Cloud operations are handled through API routes
3. Local caching is implemented with IndexedDB
4. Server-side code handles API requests and interacts with Yandex Disk API
5. Authentication is handled through OAuth tokens

## Security Considerations

1. OAuth tokens are configured via environment variables (server-side only)
2. API routes check for server-side configured authentication
3. No client-side token storage
4. Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
5. Security headers are added to all responses

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
1. Proper initialization of database service on both client and server
2. Correct handling of server-side vs client-side database operations
3. Proper error handling for network operations
4. Correct caching and synchronization between local and remote storage
5. Proper authentication flow

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more sophisticated conflict resolution for sync operations
2. Add support for folder operations (create, delete, move)
3. Implement file versioning
4. Add support for other cloud storage providers
5. Implement more advanced caching strategies
