# Markdown Cards Application

A secure, production-ready Markdown Cards application with authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive logging.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth with encrypted credentials
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per hour per IP address
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Automatic redirect to HTTPS in production
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed access logs for monitoring
- **Security Headers**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Vercel Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel deployment

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd md-cards-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate admin credentials:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-password
   ```

   This will create a `.env` file with the admin username and hashed password.

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: The admin username for authentication
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`: The bcrypt hashed password for the admin user

These are automatically generated when you run `npm run generate-password`.

## Deployment to Vercel

1. Create a new project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

2. Connect your Git repository to Vercel

3. Configure the environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME` = `admin`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` = (the hash generated by the script)

4. Set the build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.svelte-kit/output/client`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

5. Deploy the application

## Security Features

### Authentication
The application uses HTTP Basic Authentication to protect all routes. The credentials are:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: (generated during setup)

### Rate Limiting
The application implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- 100 requests per hour per IP address
- Automatic blocking of IPs that exceed the limit
- Rate limit headers in responses

### HTTPS Enforcement
In production environments, the application automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.

### Security Headers
The application includes several security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require HTTP Basic Authentication:
- `GET /` - List all cards
- `GET /card/[slug]` - View a specific card
- `POST /api/save` - Save a card
- `GET /api/files` - List all files

## Logging

The application logs various events for monitoring and debugging:
- Successful and failed login attempts
- Rate limit exceeded events
- General application events

Logs are output to the console and can be viewed in the Vercel dashboard.

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never commit the `.env` file to version control
- Regularly rotate admin credentials
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Keep dependencies up to date

### Performance
- The application uses efficient middleware with minimal overhead
- Rate limiting prevents resource exhaustion
- Static assets are served directly by Vercel's CDN

### Scalability
- The application is stateless and can be scaled horizontally
- Authentication is stateless (no sessions to manage)
- Rate limiting uses an in-memory store that works well for single instances

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If you're having trouble with authentication:
1. Verify the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` environment variables are set correctly
2. Generate new credentials with `npm run generate-password`
3. Restart the application
4. If the password hash appears truncated, check that the full hash is being loaded (the application uses a custom environment variable loader to handle long hash values correctly)

### Rate Limiting Issues
If you're being rate limited:
1. The limit is 100 requests per hour per IP
2. Wait for the rate limit to reset
3. Check logs for rate limit events

### Deployment Issues
If you're having trouble deploying to Vercel:
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in the Vercel project settings
2. Check the build logs for errors
3. Verify the build and output directory settings
